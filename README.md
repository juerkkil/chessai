# chessai
Artificial intelligence for chess game with command line UI. Bascially this is a minimax-algorithm with alpha-beta pruning implemented for chess game. Otherwise quite crappy, should't be used for anything serious.

#Compiling and running:

```
gcc ai.c io.c board.c moves.c evaluation.c main.c -std=c99 -o main 
./main
```
